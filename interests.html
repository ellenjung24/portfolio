                BAKING
            </div>
            <div class="subcontent">
                I love baking in free time! I usually bake various kinds of cookies, pound cakes, cakes,
                muffins, and scones. I feel a sense of accomplishment when I see people feel happy after eating bread I bake!

                STRETCHING
            </div>
            <div class="subcontent">
                I try to stretch as often as possible because I am usually sitting on my desk all day
                in the same posture due to work and study.
                Especially, I am stretching my legs every night as it helps me feel better both 
                mentally and physically!

                LISTENING TO MUSIC
            </div>
            <div class="subcontent">
                I enjoy listening to music while developing a website! It helps me focus on working more and 
                longer and lose track of time. Also, it makes the process more fun and interesting.
                fun and interesting. My favourite genres are POP, K-POP and DANCE!
